ShaderParticleEngine
====================
A GLSL-heavy particle engine for THREE.js. Based on [Stemkoski's great particle engine](https://github.com/stemkoski/stemkoski.github.com/blob/master/Three.js/js/ParticleEngine.js).


Pull requests and issue reports welcome.


Version 0.5.0
=============
Currently not at 1.0.0, so the API is due to change. Please be aware of this when using this library.
That said, it ain't gonna be long until it's at 1.0.0.


Changelog
=========
**Version 0.5.0**
* The latest update sees the addition of the ```ShaderParticleGroup.addPool()``` method. This allows for much easier control of emitter pools. See [the pool example](http://squarefeet.github.io/ShaderParticleEngine/examples/pool.html) for an example.
* There are also quite a few bug fixes courtesy of [Stemkoski](https://github.com/stemkoski/).
* I've also added quite a few more comments to the source-code, so it should be easier to get your head around should you want/need to dig into the internals.



About
=====
After experimenting with Stemkoski's particle engine, I was having trouble getting high numbers of particles to render at ~60fps. After digging into the code and doing some benchmarks, it was clear that the bottleneck was coming from applying each particle's movement parameters (```velocity += acceleration```, and ```position += velocity```). After moving these calculations to the shaders the performance was drastically increased.

Another optimisation I wanted was to be able to 'group' lots of emitters into one ```THREE.ParticleSystem```, so that if I had (for example) 20 particle emitters sharing the same texture, I could send all 20 of those emitters to the GPU at the same time via sharing the same geometry. This is where the basis for the ```ShaderParticleGroup``` comes from.

This project requires THREE.js revision 58/59/60.



Usage
=====
See the ```./examples/``` folder (or [here](http://squarefeet.github.io/ShaderParticleEngine/)) for some simple demos.

Assuming you have a basic scene set up using THREE.js and have added the JS to your page, adding a particle emitter is as simple as the following code:

```javascript
// Create a particle group to add the emitter to.
var particleGroup = new ShaderParticleGroup({
	// Give the particles in this group a texture
	texture: THREE.ImageUtils.loadTexture('path/to/your/texture.file'),

	// How long should the particles live for? Measured in seconds.
	maxAge: 5
});

// Create a single emitter
var particleEmitter = new ShaderParticleEmitter({
	type: 'cube',
	position: new THREE.Vector3(0, 0, 0),
	acceleration: new THREE.Vector3(0, 10, 0),
	velocity: new THREE.Vector3(0, 15, 0),
	particlesPerSecond: 100,
	size: 10,
	sizeEnd: 0,
	opacityStart: 1,
	opacityEnd: 0,
	colorStart: new THREE.Color('blue'),
	colorEnd: new THREE.Color('white')
});

// Add the emitter to the group.
particleGroup.addEmitter( particleEmitter );

// Add the particle group to the scene so it can be drawn.
scene.add( particleGroup.mesh ); // Where `scene` is an instance of `THREE.Scene`.

// ...

// In your frame render function:
// 	Where dt is the time delta
// 	(the time it took to render the last frame.)
particleGroup.tick( dt );

```

	// they aren't going to be moving, then set this property to `1`. This will
	// take the start values for color, opacity, and size (with spreads applied),
	// not add the emitter from its group's tick function, and so will be static.
	// See the static.html file in the examples directory for more.
	static: 0

####"Public" Methods for ```ShaderParticleGroup```:####

**- ```.addEmitter( emitter )```**
Adds an instance of ```ShaderParticleEmitter``` to the particle group.

**- ```.tick( dt )```**
Call this function once per frame. If no ```dt``` argument is given, the ```ShaderParticleGroup``` instance will use its ```.fixedTimeStep``` value as ```dt```.

**- ```.addPool( numEmitters, emitterSettings, createNewEmitterIfPoolRunsOut )```**
Automatically create a pool of emitters for easy triggering in the future.

**- ```.triggerPoolEmitter( numEmittersToActivate, positionVector )```**
Turn on a given number of emitters that live in a pool created using the method above. You can also pass a ```THREE.Vector3``` instance to dictate where this emitter will sit.
